This project develops a robust machine learning pipeline to analyze real estate trends and provide actionable insights. The pipeline employs clustering to segment the market, regression to predict property prices, and classification to determine property status. By integrating these techniques, the repository aims to empower data-driven decision-making in the real estate sector.
